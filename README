xDash version 1.00
==================

xDash is a framework for publish/subscribe integration of applications
(EAI). xDash is using Jabber as communication 
protocol and implementing the concept of convergence between 
backend asynchronous messaging and instant messaging.

xDash framework consists of three main modules: xDash::Sender, 
xDash::Receiver, xDash::Archivist and some other supporting modules.
Modules are developed in the object orientated way. If you need to 
customize/extend functionality of the tree main modules, you have to provide 
your own base classes/modules for some tasks, which have to implement a fixed 
set of methods (driver pattern). If you think, they can be reused, 
make them public over CPAN in the xDash namespace!
